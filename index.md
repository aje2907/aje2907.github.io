### Skin Melanoma Prediction

This project predicts the probability of a given image being a skin cancer (melanoma) or not. I have used Convolutional Neural Network to build a binary classification model, trained and validated using image dataset containing about 33000 images. I have performed EDA on the dataset, and build the model to predict only the Melanoma class. The goal of this project is to help detecting cancer at an early age using images, which greatly helps in early treatment of cancer.

### Credit Defaulter Analysis and Prediction
This project uses exploratory data analysis to identify patterns that can be used to detect potential credit defaulters. The data is used to identify the driving factors behind loan default and to assess the risk associated with lending to customers. The goal is to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected, while also minimizing the risk of loss for the company.

### Time Series Forecasting on Retail Store Sales in R
This project encompasses an empirical study aimed at forecasting retail store sales using diverse time series forecasting methods. The dataset comprises an extensive collection of 3,000,888 records, encompassing sales details from 54 different stores and 83,488 transactions. Our primary objective was to analyze sales components, such as trend and seasonality, and assess the performance of various forecasting models implemented in R programming.

We employed several forecasting methods, including seasonal naive, exponential smoothing (ETS), ARIMA, and Prophet. Each method was evaluated based on its ability to capture underlying patterns in the sales data and provide accurate predictions. The models underwent training and testing using appropriate time series evaluation techniques, with a particular emphasis on the root mean square error (RMSE) metric for assessing forecasting accuracy. Through comprehensive analysis and comparison, the Prophet model demonstrated superior performance in terms of RMSE values for the test data.
