### Leveraging AlphaFold Protein Structure Prediction to study Huntington Disease for Drug Development

Huntington’s disease is an inherited neurodegenerative condition affecting brain nerve cells due to a mutation in the Huntingtin protein's CAG repeats. Disease severity hinges on these repeats' length. Understanding the protein's function and action is challenging, hindering cure development. Scientific methods like X-ray Crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and Cryo-EM aid protein structure analysis but have limitations. Addressing this, we're using AlphaFold, an AI system by Google DeepMind, to predict 3D protein structures accurately. This helps comprehend interaction mechanisms, potentially speeding up Huntington's drug discovery.
